######### In this project I use publicly available data to visualize the trends in food production, 
######### food consumption, food expenditure, and other items I add as I get data. I am interested in food expenditure
#########  by category. For instance does expenditure on sweet/salty products went up over time.... Or how peoples diets
#########  also effect the consumption and expenditure of certain products. This is myu initial thought process. I develop
######## or add new things as I get more ideas.
